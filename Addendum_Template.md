# [Project Name] — Addendum

## What this document is

The running log of decisions, progress, and lessons. Each entry is dated and includes a receipt showing where the information came from.

**When to write here:** After making a decision. After learning something. After finishing a piece of work. After something fails.

**When to promote to the Core:** When an insight becomes a durable rule or principle that should guide future work.

## Entry format

Each day gets a heading. Entries are numbered starting at 1 for each new day.
